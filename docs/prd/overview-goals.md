# Overview & Goals

**Project Overview:**
Build a fully branded, multi-platform AI chat applicationâ€”offering an experience comparable to ChatGPT, but personalized for your business and workflow. The app is installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA), supports all media types, and communicates in real time with a powerful n8n-powered backend agent ("Jarvis"). All chat data is securely stored and synced with Supabase, enabling seamless conversation, automations, and voice interactions from any device.

**Goals:**
- Deliver a modern, installable, offline-capable chat UI that's always accessible
- Seamless integration with n8n backend for multimodal, automated agent interactions
- Persistent, searchable, and encrypted chat history
- Empower advanced features: voice calling, live note-taking, micro-automations, and project/task management
- Maintain strict brand consistency with high-quality UI/UX and engaging animation
