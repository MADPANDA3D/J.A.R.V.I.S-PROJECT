# Ideas Backlog - JARVIS Chat Application

**Purpose:** Capture and systematically evaluate ideas during development without disrupting current sprint execution.

**Process:** Ideas are logged immediately, evaluated during phase reviews, and integrated into future sprints based on priority and strategic value.

## üìã **Ideas Management Process**

### **When to Add Ideas**
- During active development when inspiration strikes
- User feedback or feature requests emerge
- Technical discoveries suggest new possibilities
- Competitive analysis reveals opportunities
- Bug fixes inspire related enhancements

### **How to Add Ideas**

#### **üöÄ QUICK METHOD: Use the *idea command**
1. **Type `*idea` when you have a new idea**
2. **Follow the conversational prompts** - Sarah (Product Owner) will guide you through:
   - Describing your idea
   - Identifying the business value
   - Assessing complexity
   - Capturing all context
3. **Idea gets automatically logged** in the appropriate section
4. **Continue with current work** - no disruption to sprint

#### **üìù Manual Method (if needed)**
1. **Log immediately** in appropriate section below
2. **Don't interrupt current sprint** - just capture the idea
3. **Include basic context** - why it's valuable, when it occurred to you
4. **Assign rough complexity** - Simple/Medium/Complex
5. **Note any dependencies** or technical requirements

### **Review Schedule**
- **End of each Phase** - Full ideas review with Product Owner
- **Sprint Retrospectives** - Quick scan for urgent items
- **Monthly Planning** - Strategic evaluation for future phases

## üîÑ **Idea Evaluation Criteria**

### **Strategic Fit Assessment**
- **MVP Alignment:** Does it enhance core chat experience?
- **User Value:** Clear benefit to end users?
- **Differentiation:** Competitive advantage or unique value?
- **Analytics Opportunity:** Provides valuable usage data?

### **Technical Feasibility**
- **Complexity Rating:** Simple (1-3 days) / Medium (1 week) / Complex (2+ weeks)
- **Dependencies:** What needs to be in place first?
- **Risk Level:** Low/Medium/High technical or user experience risk
- **Integration Impact:** How does it affect existing functionality?

### **Business Priority Matrix**
```
High Value + Low Effort = QUICK WINS (Phase 2 candidates)
High Value + High Effort = STRATEGIC PROJECTS (Phase 3-4)
Low Value + Low Effort = NICE TO HAVE (Backlog)
Low Value + High Effort = AVOID (Archive)
```
