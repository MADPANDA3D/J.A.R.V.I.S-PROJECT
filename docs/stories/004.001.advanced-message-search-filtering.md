# Story 004.001: Advanced Message Search Filtering

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - 2025-07-26

## Story

**As a** JARVIS Chat user,
**I want** enhanced message search capabilities with date range filtering, conversation session selection, and search result highlighting,
**so that** I can efficiently discover and locate specific messages within my conversation history with improved productivity and better message organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Date Range Filtering Enhancement**: Enhance the existing MessageSearch component with date range picker controls allowing users to filter search results by specific date ranges (today, last week, last month, custom range) while maintaining current search functionality

2. **Conversation Session Selection**: Implement conversation session dropdown filter within MessageSearch component using existing conversation_sessions table data to allow users to search within specific conversation contexts

3. **Search Result Highlighting**: Add search term highlighting in message text results with proper accessibility support and visual indicators to improve message discoverability

4. **Advanced Filter UI Integration**: Integrate advanced filter controls into existing ChatLayout without disrupting current chat interface, following shadcn/ui component patterns and responsive design principles

5. **Search Performance Optimization**: Optimize search queries for enhanced filtering using existing Supabase chat_messages table indexes and maintain responsive search performance

6. **Persistent Search State**: Implement search state persistence across component re-renders and navigation to maintain user's search context and filter selections

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 003.003: UpdateNotification component integration patterns and environment variable management established. WebSocket connection patterns and shadcn/ui component integration approaches can be referenced for consistent implementation.

### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Supabase (@supabase/supabase-js 2.52.1) for PostgreSQL database and real-time subscriptions
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 for styling
- React Query (@tanstack/react-query 5.83.0) for server state management

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- MessageSearch component located at `src/components/chat/MessageSearch.tsx`
- Chat service utilities at `src/lib/chatService.ts`
- UI components in `src/components/ui/` directory
- Tests in `__tests__/` directories alongside components

**Data Flow Patterns** [Source: architecture/data-flows.md]:
- Chat messages stored in Supabase chat_messages table
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Frontend queries via chatService.ts methods
- Conversation sessions tracked in conversation_sessions table

### Component Integration Points

**Existing MessageSearch Component**: Currently provides basic text search functionality, needs enhancement with advanced filtering capabilities while maintaining existing API

**ChatLayout Integration** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#L54]: MessageSearch.tsx is integrated within ChatLayout component, enhancements must preserve current layout and user experience

**Database Schema**: 
- chat_messages table: Contains message content, timestamps, user_id, session_id
- conversation_sessions table: Contains session metadata for conversation organization

### File Locations and Structure

**Component Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Primary: `src/components/chat/MessageSearch.tsx`
- Service: `src/lib/chatService.ts`
- Layout: `src/components/chat/ChatLayout.tsx`
- UI Components: `src/components/ui/` (button.tsx, dropdown-menu.tsx, input.tsx)

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Test files: `src/components/chat/__tests__/MessageSearch.test.tsx`
- Framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Coverage: All components must have comprehensive tests
- Testing patterns: Component testing with user interaction simulation

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Considerations** [Source: epic file]:
- Search result pagination required for large message histories
- Query optimization using existing Supabase indexing
- Debounced search input to minimize API calls

**Accessibility Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Proper ARIA labels for search components
- Screen reader compatibility for search results and highlighting

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Functional components with proper interfaces
- Use absolute imports with @/ alias
- ESLint and Prettier formatting required

### Integration Pattern Reference

**Component Enhancement Approach**: Follow patterns established in previous stories for extending existing components while maintaining backward compatibility and current functionality

**State Management**: Use existing React hooks patterns and integrate with current useChat hook for consistent state handling across chat functionality

## Testing

### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Test File Location**: `src/components/chat/__tests__/MessageSearch.test.tsx`

**Testing Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library with jsdom environment

**Testing Patterns**:
- Component rendering and prop handling tests
- User interaction simulation with @testing-library/user-event
- Mock Supabase service calls for search functionality
- Accessibility testing with proper ARIA label verification

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Date range picker interaction and validation testing
- Conversation session dropdown functionality testing  
- Search result highlighting verification with screen reader compatibility
- Search performance testing with large result sets
- Integration testing with existing ChatLayout component

**Coverage Requirements**: All new search functionality must have comprehensive test coverage including error scenarios, loading states, and edge cases
