From Story 003.003: UpdateNotification component integration patterns and environment variable management established. WebSocket connection patterns and shadcn/ui component integration approaches can be referenced for consistent implementation.

### Architecture Context

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Supabase (@supabase/supabase-js 2.52.1) for PostgreSQL database and real-time subscriptions
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 for styling
- React Query (@tanstack/react-query 5.83.0) for server state management

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- MessageSearch component located at `src/components/chat/MessageSearch.tsx`
- Chat service utilities at `src/lib/chatService.ts`
- UI components in `src/components/ui/` directory
- Tests in `__tests__/` directories alongside components

**Data Flow Patterns** [Source: architecture/data-flows.md]:
- Chat messages stored in Supabase chat_messages table
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Frontend queries via chatService.ts methods
- Conversation sessions tracked in conversation_sessions table

### Component Integration Points

**Existing MessageSearch Component**: Currently provides basic text search functionality, needs enhancement with advanced filtering capabilities while maintaining existing API

**ChatLayout Integration** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#L54]: MessageSearch.tsx is integrated within ChatLayout component, enhancements must preserve current layout and user experience

**Database Schema**: 
- chat_messages table: Contains message content, timestamps, user_id, session_id
- conversation_sessions table: Contains session metadata for conversation organization

### File Locations and Structure

**Component Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Primary: `src/components/chat/MessageSearch.tsx`
- Service: `src/lib/chatService.ts`
- Layout: `src/components/chat/ChatLayout.tsx`
- UI Components: `src/components/ui/` (button.tsx, dropdown-menu.tsx, input.tsx)

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Test files: `src/components/chat/__tests__/MessageSearch.test.tsx`
- Framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Coverage: All components must have comprehensive tests
- Testing patterns: Component testing with user interaction simulation

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Considerations** [Source: epic file]:
- Search result pagination required for large message histories
- Query optimization using existing Supabase indexing
- Debounced search input to minimize API calls

**Accessibility Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Proper ARIA labels for search components
- Screen reader compatibility for search results and highlighting

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
