## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Context (from Architecture)
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Package Manager**: Yarn (specified in user requirements)
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on Hostinger VPS

### Brand Guidelines (from PRD & User Requirements)
- **Color Scheme**: Black/White/Crimson Red primary with neon spectrum accents
- **Theme**: Dark theme with glowing neon elements
- **Design Philosophy**: Minimalist, high-tech aesthetic
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first responsive design

### Integration Requirements (from Architecture)
- **Supabase**: Frontend will integrate with Supabase for auth and data
- **n8n Backend**: Will connect to existing n8n webhooks for AI functionality
- **PWA**: Must be configured for Progressive Web App capabilities

### Key Dependencies (from Sprint 1 Plan)
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.8.0",
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.38.0",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.0.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "latest",
    "prettier": "latest",
    "husky": "latest",
    "@types/react": "latest",
    "typescript": "latest"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables Setup
Prepare for these environment variables (values to be provided in next stories):
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  
- VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL
- VITE_APP_DOMAIN=jarvis.madpanda3d.com

### Performance Considerations (from PRD)
- Target <100ms message send time under normal conditions
- App startup time <3s on target devices
- Must be highly responsive on both mobile and desktop

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: `src/__tests__/` for unit tests, `e2e/` for end-to-end tests
- **Test Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Coverage Target**: >90% for critical components
- **Test File Naming**: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- **Test Standards**: 
  - Each component should have corresponding test file
  - Test user interactions, not implementation details
  - Use data-testid for reliable test selectors
  - Mock external dependencies (Supabase, n8n)

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Clean Setup**: Any developer should be able to run the project immediately after clone
2. **Code Quality**: All code quality tools must work correctly from the start
3. **Brand Consistency**: Theme implementation must match exact specifications
4. **Docker Readiness**: Container must build and run correctly for deployment
5. **TypeScript Strict**: All TypeScript errors must be resolved, no 'any' types
