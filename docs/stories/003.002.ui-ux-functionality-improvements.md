## Story Title

UI/UX Critical Functionality Fixes - Brownfield Enhancement

## User Story

As a **JARVIS Chat user**,
I want **the interface elements to work correctly and intuitively**,
So that **I can navigate and use the application without encountering broken functionality or confusing behavior**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: React Router, shadcn/ui components, Radix UI dropdown primitives, error boundary system
- Technology: React/TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives, CSS-in-JS patterns
- Follows pattern: shadcn/ui component architecture, error handling with fallback UI
- Touch points: ToolsSelector component, Sidebar component, Settings/Health pages, ErrorFallback component, Tasks page layout

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Tools Dropdown Behavior Fix:**
   - Tools dropdown must behave as a proper dropdown menu positioned relative to trigger button
   - Dropdown content must not slide across the page or appear detached from trigger
   - Dropdown must use proper z-index layering and portal positioning

2. **Left Sidebar Scrolling Fix:**
   - Sidebar must be independently scrollable when content overflows
   - Mouse wheel events over sidebar must scroll sidebar content, not the main page
   - Scroll behavior must work consistently across desktop and mobile viewports

3. **Settings & Health Button Error Fixes:**
   - Settings page must load without showing "Something went wrong" error modal
   - Health page must load without showing "Something went wrong" error modal
   - "Go Home" buttons in error modals must navigate to `/chat` route successfully

4. **Tasks Page Layout Fix:**
   - Excessive whitespace above Tasks header must be reduced to match other pages
   - Page content must be properly aligned with standard layout margins
   - Header positioning must be consistent with Settings and Health pages

5. **Error Modal UX Improvements:**
   - Error modals must show either "Try Again" OR "Reload" button, not both
   - All buttons in error modals must have working functionality
   - "Report Issue" button functionality must be preserved and working

**Integration Requirements:**

6. Existing routing behavior continues to work unchanged
7. New error handling follows existing ErrorBoundary pattern  
8. Integration with shadcn/ui components maintains current styling consistency

**Quality Requirements:**

9. Changes are covered by appropriate component tests
10. CSS changes follow existing Tailwind utility patterns
11. No regression in existing navigation or component functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Direct fixes to existing components without architectural changes
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow shadcn/ui dropdown positioning patterns, standard CSS scroll container patterns
- **Key Constraints:** 
  - Must maintain existing component API interfaces
  - Cannot break existing responsive design
  - Must preserve accessibility features already implemented

## Definition of Done

- [x] Tools dropdown positions correctly relative to trigger button
- [x] Sidebar scrolls independently without affecting main page scroll
- [x] Settings page loads successfully without error modal
- [x] Health page loads successfully without error modal  
- [x] Tasks page header spacing matches other pages
- [x] Error modals show only necessary buttons (not both Try Again + Reload)
- [x] All error modal buttons navigate/function correctly
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Component tests updated for changed behavior
- [x] Visual consistency verified across viewport sizes

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** CSS positioning changes could affect dropdown behavior on different screen sizes
- **Mitigation:** Test dropdown positioning across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **Rollback:** Revert specific CSS classes and component state changes

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing component APIs
- [ ] Database changes - None required
- [ ] UI changes follow existing shadcn/ui design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (CSS-only changes)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [x] Story can be completed in one development session (4 hours focused work)
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward (component-level fixes)
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly (shadcn/ui components, error boundaries)
- [x] No design or architecture work required (fixing existing functionality)

**Clarity Check:**

- [x] Story requirements are unambiguous (5 specific UI fixes defined)
- [x] Integration points are clearly specified (component boundaries)
- [x] Success criteria are testable (visual and functional verification)
- [x] Rollback approach is simple (revert component changes)

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Tools Dropdown Positioning Fix
```typescript
// In ToolsSelector.tsx - Update DropdownMenuContent positioning
<DropdownMenuContent
  className="w-80 max-h-96 overflow-y-auto"
  align="end"
  side="bottom" // Change from "top" to "bottom" for better positioning
  sideOffset={8} // Add proper offset
  avoidCollisions={true} // Ensure proper collision detection
/>
```

### 2. Sidebar Scroll Behavior Fix
```typescript
// In Sidebar.tsx - Add proper scroll container styling
<nav
  className="p-4 space-y-2 overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain" // Add scroll handling
  style={{ maxHeight: 'calc(100vh - 120px)' }} // Constraint height
  onWheel={(e) => e.stopPropagation()} // Prevent event bubbling
>
```

### 3. Settings/Health Page Error Resolution
- Investigate error boundary triggers in Settings/HealthPage components
- Add proper error handling for async operations
- Ensure all hook dependencies are properly managed

### 4. Tasks Page Layout Alignment
```typescript
// In TasksPage.tsx - Reduce top padding/margin
<div className="p-6 pt-4"> {/* Reduce from p-6 to pt-4 */}
  <div className="max-w-6xl mx-auto space-y-6">
```

### 5. Error Modal Button Cleanup
```typescript
// In ErrorFallback.tsx - Consolidate action buttons
<div className="flex gap-2">
  <Button onClick={resetError}>Try Again</Button>
  {/* Remove redundant Reload button OR consolidate functionality */}
</div>
```

## Testing Approach

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Verify dropdown positioning across screen sizes
   - Test sidebar scroll behavior with mouse wheel
   - Navigate to Settings/Health pages and verify no errors
   - Check Tasks page header alignment
   - Trigger error states and verify modal button behavior

2. **Automated Testing:**
   - Update existing component tests for changed behavior
   - Add tests for scroll event handling
   - Verify error boundary behavior
