- **JARVIS-013 (Task Management):** Complexity of context switching and data organization
- **JARVIS-017 (Testing Suite):** Time-intensive with potential for uncovering major issues

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### External Dependencies
- **Supabase:** Database, authentication, real-time, storage setup
- **n8n Backend:** Webhook endpoints, TTS/STT integration, automation workflows
- **TTS/STT APIs:** Voice processing capabilities
- **Domain & SSL:** Production deployment requirements

### Internal Dependencies
- **Design System:** Brand colors, logos, icons, animation specifications
- **API Contracts:** n8n webhook specifications and response formats
- **Infrastructure:** Production hosting, CDN, monitoring setup

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Message send time <100ms (measured in JARVIS-016)
- [ ] Voice call success rate >95% (measured in JARVIS-012)
- [ ] PWA installation rate >60% (measured in JARVIS-011)
- [ ] Test coverage >90% critical components (measured in JARVIS-017)
- [ ] Accessibility score 90+ (measured in JARVIS-019)

### User Experience Metrics

## Development Approach

### Sprint Planning Recommendations
- **2-week sprints** with 20-25 story points per sprint
- **Phase boundaries** align with sprint boundaries for clean milestones
- **Critical path focus:** Prioritize voice calling and core chat functionality
- **Risk mitigation:** Tackle high-risk stories early in each phase

### Quality Gates
- **Phase 1:** Authentication works, basic chat functional, PWA installs
- **Phase 2:** Complete media support, real-time sync operational
- **Phase 3:** Voice calls stable, all advanced features working
- **Phase 4:** Production ready, all audits passed, deployed successfully

## Resource Allocation

### Development Team Structure
- **1 Senior Full-Stack Developer** (Epic owner, architecture decisions)
- **1 Frontend Specialist** (PWA, React expertise, UI/UX implementation)
- **1 Backend Integration Specialist** (n8n, Supabase, API integration)
- **1 QA Engineer** (Testing, accessibility, security validation)

### Time Allocation by Discipline
