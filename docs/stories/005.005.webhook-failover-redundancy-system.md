**Builds on Complete Infrastructure**: All previous stories (005.001-005.004) provide the foundation: authentication, payload handling, GitHub Actions integration, and monitoring that this redundancy system will protect and enhance.

### Technical Context

**Existing Redundancy Patterns** [Source: docs/stories/002.002.finalize-n8n-webhook-integration-testing.md]:
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Existing circuit breaker implementation with failure threshold configuration
- **Retry Logic**: Current exponential backoff algorithm with configurable retry attempts
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Established fallback patterns for webhook service degradation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Existing webhook health monitoring for redundancy detection

**VPS Infrastructure Requirements**:
- **Primary Webhook Server**: Current Express.js server on port 9000 with full functionality
- **Backup Webhook Server**: Secondary server instance on alternative port for redundancy
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent traffic routing between primary and backup endpoints
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks for failover decision making

### Architecture Integration

**Webhook Server Redundancy Architecture**:
```javascript
// Failover configuration structure
{
  "primary_endpoint": {
    "url": "http://69.62.71.229:9000/webhook/deploy",
    "port": 9000,
    "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
    "last_health_check": "2025-07-26T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "backup_endpoints": [
    {
      "url": "http://69.62.71.229:9001/webhook/deploy", 
      "port": 9001,
      "status": "healthy",
      "priority": 1
    }
  ],
  "failover_config": {
    "health_check_interval": 30,
    "failover_threshold": 3,
    "recovery_threshold": 5,
    "max_response_time": 5000
  }
}
```

**Enhanced Retry Logic Architecture**:
```javascript
// Advanced retry configuration
{
  "retry_policy": {
    "max_attempts": 5,
    "base_delay": 1000,
    "max_delay": 32000,
    "backoff_multiplier": 2,

    "permanent_errors": [400, 401, 403, 404, "AUTHENTICATION_FAILED"]
  }
}
```

### Integration with Previous Stories

**Story 005.001 Integration**:
- Backup webhook servers use identical webhook secret synchronization for authentication
- Failover system maintains webhook signature verification across all endpoints
- Environment variable configuration extends to backup server instances

**Story 005.002 Integration**:
- Backup webhook servers implement identical ping and workflow_run event handling
- Failover system preserves event type validation and payload processing capabilities
- Enhanced retry logic applies to all webhook event types

**Story 005.003 Integration**:
- GitHub Actions workflow integrates with failover webhook endpoint configuration
- Backup endpoints support identical workflow_run event processing for deployment automation

- Performance metrics include failover response times and retry attempt analytics

### Failover Decision Logic

**Health Check Integration**:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Leverage health check system from Story 005.004 for failover decisions
- **Response Time Monitoring**: Track webhook endpoint response times for performance-based failover
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Monitor webhook delivery success rates for quality-based failover decisions

**Failover Triggers**:
```javascript
// Failover decision criteria
const shouldFailover = (primaryEndpoint) => {
  return (
    primaryEndpoint.status === 'unhealthy' ||
    primaryEndpoint.consecutive_failures >= 3 ||
    primaryEndpoint.avg_response_time > 5000 ||
    primaryEndpoint.success_rate < 95
  );
};
```

**Recovery Detection**:
```javascript
// Primary server recovery validation
const canRecoverToPrimary = (primaryEndpoint) => {
  return (
    primaryEndpoint.status === 'healthy' &&
    primaryEndpoint.consecutive_successes >= 5 &&
    primaryEndpoint.avg_response_time < 2000 &&
    primaryEndpoint.success_rate > 98
  );
};
```

### Webhook Delivery Verification

**Delivery Confirmation System**:
- **Response Validation**: Verify webhook endpoints return expected response formats
- **Processing Confirmation**: Poll deployment automation status to confirm successful triggering
- **Timeout Handling**: Implement configurable timeouts for delivery verification
- **Error Classification**: Distinguish between delivery failures and processing delays

**Verification Flow**:
1. **Webhook Delivery**: Send webhook payload to active endpoint (primary or backup)
2. **Response Validation**: Verify webhook endpoint responds with expected format and status
3. **Processing Polling**: Monitor deployment automation system for successful trigger confirmation
4. **Success Confirmation**: Mark delivery as verified when deployment automation begins
5. **Failure Handling**: Trigger retry logic or failover if verification fails

### File Locations and Structure
