2. **Production Environment Validation**: Create diagnostic tools to validate critical production environment variables (VITE_APP_ENV, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET) and provide clear error reporting for missing or invalid configuration

3. **Authentication Error Debugging**: Implement detailed authentication error tracking and debugging capabilities to diagnose Supabase connection issues, 401 authentication failures, and RLS policy problems with actionable error reporting

4. **Runtime Error Investigation System**: Create comprehensive JavaScript runtime error tracking with proper error boundaries, detailed error logging, and diagnostic information for undefined object access and component initialization failures

5. **Real-time Log Streaming Interface**: Develop web-based log streaming interface that connects to existing WebSocket log service (ws://69.62.71.229:9001) to provide real-time access to VPS logs, deployment status, and system health monitoring

6. **Production System Health Verification**: Implement automated health check system to verify VPS server accessibility, webhook server status (port 9000), auto-deployment pipeline functionality, and log return service operational status
