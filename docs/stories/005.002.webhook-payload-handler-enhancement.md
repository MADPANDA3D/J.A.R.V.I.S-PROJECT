# Story 005.002: Webhook Payload Handler Enhancement

## Status
âœ… **Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** webhook server to handle both ping and workflow_run events properly,  
**so that** webhook testing and actual deployments both work correctly without server errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Ping Event Handler**: Implement proper ping event handler for GitHub webhook testing with appropriate response structure
2. **Event Type Validation**: Add comprehensive event type validation to differentiate between ping, workflow_run, and other GitHub webhook events
3. **Response Structure**: Create proper JSON response structure for each event type with status confirmation and timestamp
4. **Logging Integration**: Integrate ping event handling with existing webhook logging system using established patterns
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for unknown event types and malformed payloads with fallback responses

## Dev Notes

### Epic 005 Context

**Current Issue**: Server only handles workflow_run events, but GitHub sends ping events for testing. This causes webhook testing to fail and prevents proper validation of webhook configuration.

**Integration with Story 005.001**: This story builds on the webhook secret synchronization to ensure proper event handling once authentication is working.

### Technical Context

**Webhook Server Architecture** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Express Server**: VPS webhook server on port 9000 with existing `/webhook/deploy` and `/webhook/logs` endpoints
- **Webhook Service**: `src/lib/webhookService.ts` with established patterns for payload processing
- **Logging System**: Existing `logAction` function for webhook event tracking and monitoring

**GitHub Webhook Events** [Source: epic-005-webhook-infrastructure-enhancement.md]:
- **Ping Events**: Sent by GitHub for webhook testing and configuration validation
- **Workflow_run Events**: Sent when GitHub Actions workflows complete for deployment automation
- **Event Headers**: `X-GitHub-Event` header specifies event type for proper routing

### Required Code Implementation

**Ping Event Handler Logic** [Source: epic-005-webhook-infrastructure-enhancement.md]:
```javascript
// Add ping event handler to webhook server
if (event === 'ping') {
    await logAction('WEBHOOK_PING', {
        zen: data.zen,
        hook_id: data.hook_id,
        repository: data.repository?.name
    });

    res.json({
        message: 'Webhook ping received successfully',
        status: 'healthy',
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
    return;
}
```

### Architecture Integration

**Existing Webhook Patterns** [Source: docs/stories/002.002.finalize-n8n-webhook-integration-testing.md]:
- Built on existing Express.js middleware architecture
- Maintains established webhook monitoring and logging patterns
- Preserves existing error handling and retry logic infrastructure
- Integrates with current WebSocket notification system for deployment events

**Event Processing Flow**:
1. **Request Reception**: Express.js webhook endpoint receives GitHub webhook payload
2. **Authentication**: Signature verification using synchronized webhook secret (Story 005.001)
3. **Event Classification**: Extract and validate `X-GitHub-Event` header
4. **Event Routing**: Direct to appropriate handler (ping, workflow_run, or error)
5. **Response Generation**: Return appropriate JSON response structure
6. **Logging**: Record event details using existing logging infrastructure

### Webhook Event Structure

**Ping Event Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "zen": "GitHub zen message",
  "hook_id": 12345678,
  "hook": {
    "type": "Repository",
    "id": 12345678
  },
  "repository": {
    "id": 123456789,
    "name": "repository-name",
    "full_name": "owner/repository-name"
  }
}
```

**Expected Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "message": "Webhook ping received successfully",
  "status": "healthy", 
  "timestamp": "2025-07-26T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Integration Points

**Express.js Webhook Server**:
- Existing webhook endpoint handlers at `/webhook/deploy` and `/webhook/logs`
- Current payload processing middleware for signature verification
- Established error handling patterns for webhook failures

**Logging System Integration**:
- Existing `logAction` function for structured webhook event logging
- Current webhook monitoring patterns for performance tracking
- Integration with webhook analytics and health monitoring

**WebSocket Notification System**:
- Maintain existing WebSocket server on port 9001 for deployment notifications
- Preserve current client notification patterns for deployment status updates
- No changes required to WebSocket integration (ping events don't trigger deployments)

### File Locations and Structure

**Webhook Server Implementation**:
- **VPS Webhook Server**: Express.js server process handling webhook endpoints
- **Webhook Service**: `jarvis-chat/src/lib/webhookService.ts` (extend existing patterns)
- **Webhook Monitoring**: `jarvis-chat/src/lib/webhookMonitoring.ts` (existing logging integration)

**Event Handler Implementation**:
- Extend existing webhook endpoint handlers with ping event detection
- Add event type validation middleware to existing Express.js routing
- Enhance existing error handling middleware for unsupported events

### Technical Requirements

**Event Type Detection**:
- Parse `X-GitHub-Event` header from incoming webhook requests
- Validate event type against supported events (ping, workflow_run)
- Implement case-insensitive event type matching for robustness

**Response Format Consistency**:
- Maintain JSON response format consistency across all event types
- Include proper HTTP status codes (200 OK for success, 400 for errors)
- Ensure response timing consistency with existing webhook performance targets

**Error Handling Enhancement**:
- Graceful handling of malformed JSON payloads
- Informative error messages for unsupported webhook event types
- Proper HTTP status code responses for different error scenarios

### Testing Requirements

**Ping Event Testing**:
- GitHub webhook testing interface validation
- Mock ping payload processing with proper response verification
- Integration testing with webhook secret authentication

**Regression Testing**:
- Existing workflow_run event processing must continue working
- Webhook logging patterns must remain consistent
- WebSocket notification system must not be affected

**Error Scenario Testing**:
- Unknown event type handling and error responses
- Malformed payload processing and graceful degradation
- Network error scenarios and timeout handling

## Testing
