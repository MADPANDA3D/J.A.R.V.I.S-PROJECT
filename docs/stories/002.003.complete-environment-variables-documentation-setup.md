## Dev Notes

### Current Environment Validation Status
**From Sprint 2 Handoff [Source: sprint2-developer-handoff.md]:**
- Basic environment validation exists in `src/lib/env-validation.ts`
- Environment templates needed for staging/production
- Runtime environment health checks required
- Secure secrets management patterns needed

### Environment Configuration Requirements
**From Sprint 2 Epic [Source: sprint2-production-readiness-epic.md]:**
- Complete environment variable documentation
- Environment templates for different deployments
- Automated environment validation on startup
- Secure secrets management (HashiCorp Vault or similar)

### Environment Variable Categories
```typescript
// Environment variable organization
interface EnvironmentConfig {
  // Application Settings
  app: {
    env: 'development' | 'staging' | 'production';
    version: string;
    domain: string;
    cdnUrl?: string;
  };
  
  // Database & Authentication
  supabase: {
    url: string;
    anonKey: string;
    serviceRoleKey?: string;
  };
  
  // External Integrations
  n8n: {
    webhookUrl: string;
    webhookSecret: string;
    apiKey?: string;
  };
  
  // Monitoring & Logging
  monitoring: {
    sentryDsn?: string;
    datadogApiKey?: string;
    logLevel: 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
    enableMetrics: boolean;
  };
  
  // Performance & Security
  performance: {
    enableCaching: boolean;
    cacheTtl: number;
    compressionEnabled: boolean;
    rateLimitWindow: number;
    rateLimitMaxRequests: number;
  };
}
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

**Development Environment:**
```env
VITE_APP_ENV=development
VITE_APP_VERSION=dev
VITE_APP_DOMAIN=localhost:5173
LOG_LEVEL=debug
ENABLE_DEBUG_TOOLS=true
```

**Staging Environment:**
```env
VITE_APP_ENV=staging
VITE_APP_DOMAIN=staging-jarvis.madpanda3d.com
VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://staging-n8n.madpanda3d.com/webhook/jarvis
LOG_LEVEL=info
ENABLE_METRICS=true
```

**Production Environment:**
```env
VITE_APP_ENV=production
VITE_APP_DOMAIN=jarvis.madpanda3d.com
VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.madpanda3d.com/webhook/jarvis
LOG_LEVEL=warn
ENABLE_CACHING=true
COMPRESSION_ENABLED=true
```

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit actual secrets to version control
- Use environment-specific secret management
- Implement secret rotation procedures
- Monitor for secret exposure in logs
- Regular security audits of configuration

### Validation Strategy
```typescript
// Enhanced validation approach
interface ValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: string[];
  warnings: string[];
  environment: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

const validateEnvironment = (): ValidationResult => {
  // Required variables validation
  // Format and type validation
  // Cross-variable dependency checks
  // Security configuration validation
  // Performance setting validation
};
```
