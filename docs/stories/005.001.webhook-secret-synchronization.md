# Story 005.001: Webhook Secret Synchronization

## Status
âœ… **Ready for Development**

## Story
**As a** DevOps team member,  
**I want** synchronized webhook secrets between GitHub and VPS,  
**so that** webhook authentication succeeds and deployments trigger automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**: Set WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable on VPS to match GitHub webhook secret
2. **Webhook Server Restart**: Restart webhook server with correct environment variable to enable signature verification
3. **Signature Verification Testing**: Verify webhook signature verification works with synchronized secrets
4. **Payload Processing Validation**: Test successful webhook payload processing with authenticated requests
5. **Documentation**: Document environment variable management procedures for future webhook configurations

  - [ ] Add webhook configuration validation checklist

## Dev Notes

### Epic 005 Context

**Critical Production Issue**: GitHub webhook is not configured or not reaching the VPS webhook server. Environment variable WEBHOOK_SECRET not set on VPS, causing signature verification to fail with default value.

**Root Cause**: Missing environment variable synchronization between GitHub repository webhook configuration and VPS webhook server environment.

### Technical Context

**Webhook Service Architecture** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Webhook Service**: `src/lib/webhookService.ts` with existing retry logic and circuit breaker pattern
- **Webhook Monitoring**: Existing monitoring infrastructure with performance tracking  
- **Express Server**: VPS webhook server on port 9000 with endpoints `/webhook/deploy` and `/webhook/logs`
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time notifications on port 9001 for deployment events

**Environment Configuration** [Source: epic-005-webhook-infrastructure-enhancement.md]:
- **GitHub Secret**: `bxWGYH5dx8/IS8AJOKokMWaXmdAWsQ87IfZSt38zNo0yX0g1BiHTezqxR6rstM4h`
- **VPS Location**: `/root/J.A.R.V.I.S/J.A.R.V.I.S-PROJECT/.env`
- **Environment Variable**: `WEBHOOK_SECRET=bxWGYH5dx8/IS8AJOKokMWaXmdAWsQ87IfZSt38zNo0yX0g1BiHTezqxR6rstM4h`

### Integration Points

**GitHub Webhook Configuration**:
- Repository webhook settings must point to VPS webhook endpoints
- Webhook events: `workflow_run` for deployment automation, `ping` for testing
- Content-Type: `application/json` with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification

**VPS Webhook Server**:
- Express.js server on port 9000 with signature verification middleware
- Environment variable loading from `.env` file for WEBHOOK_SECRET
- Existing webhook handlers for deployment and logging events

**Signature Verification Process**:
- HMAC-SHA256 calculation using webhook secret and payload body
- Comparison with `X-Hub-Signature-256` header from GitHub
- Rejection of requests with invalid or missing signatures

### Architecture Integration

**Webhook Service Enhancement** [Source: docs/stories/002.002.finalize-n8n-webhook-integration-testing.md]:
- Built on existing webhook service patterns with retry logic and circuit breaker
- Maintains existing webhook monitoring and performance tracking
- Preserves current error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Real-time Notification System**:
- WebSocket server on port 9001 continues providing deployment notifications
- Integration with existing notification patterns for deployment status updates
- Maintains existing client connection handling and message broadcasting

### Technical Requirements

**Environment Variable Security**:
- Secure storage of webhook secret in VPS environment configuration
- Proper file permissions on `.env` file to prevent unauthorized access
- Regular rotation procedures for webhook secrets (future consideration)

**Signature Verification Implementation**:
- HMAC-SHA256 hash calculation using Node.js crypto module
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Proper error handling for malformed or missing signature headers

**Service Restart Procedures**:
- Graceful shutdown of existing webhook server process
- Environment variable reloading on service restart
- Health check verification after restart to ensure proper operation

### File Locations and Structure

**Environment Configuration**:
- **VPS Environment File**: `/root/J.A.R.V.I.S/J.A.R.V.I.S-PROJECT/.env`
- **Webhook Service**: `jarvis-chat/src/lib/webhookService.ts` (existing)
- **Webhook Monitoring**: `jarvis-chat/src/lib/webhookMonitoring.ts` (existing)

**Server Configuration**:
- **Express Webhook Server**: VPS server process on port 9000
- **WebSocket Server**: VPS server process on port 9001  
- **Deployment Scripts**: Existing deployment automation scripts

### Testing Requirements

**Authentication Testing**:
- Webhook signature verification with correct secret
- Signature mismatch rejection with proper error responses
- Payload processing with authenticated requests

**Integration Testing**:
- GitHub webhook delivery to VPS endpoints
- End-to-end deployment trigger testing
- WebSocket notification system verification

**Error Handling Validation**:

**Testing Patterns**:
- Mock GitHub webhook payload generation with proper signatures
- Environment variable testing with test-specific configuration
- Integration testing with mock webhook server responses

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- **Environment Variable Loading**: Test webhook secret loading from environment configuration
- **Signature Verification**: Test HMAC-SHA256 signature calculation and validation
- **Error Scenarios**: Test missing secret, invalid signature, and malformed payload handling
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete webhook delivery from GitHub to VPS processing

**Security Testing**:
- Verify webhook secret is not logged or exposed in application logs
- Test signature verification prevents unauthorized webhook access
- Validate environment variable file permissions and access controls
