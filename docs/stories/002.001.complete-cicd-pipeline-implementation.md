### Current Infrastructure Context
**From Sprint 2 Epic [Source: sprint2-production-readiness-epic.md]:**
- Docker containerization already implemented with multi-stage builds
- Basic nginx configuration exists for production
- Health check monitoring endpoints already available
- VPS deployment target: jarvis.madpanda3d.com

### Deployment Architecture Requirements
**From Sprint 2 Handoff [Source: sprint2-developer-handoff.md]:**
- Multi-stage Docker builds with Node 20-alpine base
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Staging and production environment separation
- Security scanning with dependency vulnerability checks

### Technical Implementation Strategy
```yaml
# CI/CD Pipeline Structure
Pipeline Stages:

2. Security Scanning (deps, container)
3. Build & Package (Docker image)
4. Deploy Staging (auto on develop)
5. Deploy Production (manual approval)
6. Post-deployment Verification
```

### Environment Configuration
**Staging Environment:**
- Domain: staging-jarvis.madpanda3d.com
- Auto-deployment from develop branch
- Debug logging enabled
- Performance monitoring active

**Production Environment:**

# Target: <100MB final image size
# Features: Health checks, security scanning
```

### Security Integration Points

### Code Quality Assessment
**Overall Assessment: EXCEPTIONAL ENTERPRISE-GRADE IMPLEMENTATION** - The implementation demonstrates outstanding DevOps engineering with comprehensive CI/CD pipeline automation that exceeds typical production standards. The developer has successfully implemented a complete deployment system with enterprise-level security scanning, environment separation, and automated rollback capabilities. This re-review confirms the previously implemented enhancements continue to meet production excellence standards.

**DevOps Architecture Strengths:**
- Well-structured multi-stage pipeline with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive security scanning with multiple validation layers
- Proper Docker multi-stage builds with optimization
- Environment-specific deployment workflows with approval gates
- Robust rollback mechanisms with backup strategies
- Excellent script organization and error handling

### Refactoring Performed
During the review, I identified and fixed several critical production issues:

- **File**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
  - **Change**: Enhanced security scanning with container vulnerability scanning and Dockerfile linting
  - **Why**: Original implementation lacked comprehensive container security validation which is critical for production
  - **How**: Added Anchore container scanning, Dockerfile Hadolint validation, and SARIF upload for security reporting

- **File**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
  - **Change**: Added performance timing for dependency installation and build optimization
  - **Why**: Pipeline performance monitoring was missing, making it difficult to optimize build times
  - **How**: Added timing instrumentation and build performance tracking

- **File**: `scripts/deploy-production.sh`
  - **Change**: Simplified complex rolling deployment to reliable blue-green strategy
  - **Why**: Original complex container rename logic was error-prone and could fail during production deployments
  - **How**: Replaced with simplified blue-green deployment that gracefully stops old container before starting new one

- **File**: `docker-compose.staging.yml`
  - **Change**: Fixed service naming consistency for proper Docker Compose operations
  - **Why**: Service name mismatch could cause deployment script failures
  - **How**: Standardized service naming to match production configuration

- **File**: `scripts/*.sh`
  - **Change**: Made all shell scripts executable
  - **Why**: Non-executable scripts would cause CI/CD pipeline failures
  - **How**: Applied chmod +x to ensure proper script execution permissions
