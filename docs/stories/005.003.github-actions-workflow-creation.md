## Dev Notes

### Epic 005 Context

**Integration Requirements**: This story creates the missing GitHub Actions workflow that will trigger the VPS webhook server for automated deployments. Builds on Stories 005.001 (webhook authentication) and 005.002 (payload handling).

**Current Gap**: Manual deployment process needs automation through GitHub Actions workflow that triggers webhook calls to VPS on successful builds.

### Technical Context

**GitHub Actions Integration** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated build and deployment
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.0.4 for production builds with TypeScript compilation
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.2.4 for automated testing before deployment
- **Node.js Version**: Version 20 for consistency with development environment

**Workflow Configuration** [Source: epic-005-webhook-infrastructure-enhancement.md]:
```yaml
name: Deploy to VPS
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd jarvis-chat && npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: cd jarvis-chat && npm test
      - name: Build application
        run: cd jarvis-chat && npm run build
      - name: Deployment successful
        run: echo "Build completed successfully - webhook will trigger deployment"
```

### Architecture Integration

**Existing Deployment Pipeline** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Application Directory**: `jarvis-chat/` contains the main React application
- **Build Configuration**: Vite configuration for production builds
- **Package Management**: npm with `package.json` dependency management
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest configuration for automated testing

**VPS Integration Points**:
- **Webhook Server**: VPS webhook server on port 9000 ready to receive workflow_run events
- **Webhook Authentication**: Story 005.001 provides webhook secret synchronization
- **Event Handling**: Story 005.002 provides workflow_run event processing capability

### GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

**Trigger Configuration**:
- **Event Type**: Push events to main branch only
- **Workflow Dispatch**: Manual trigger capability for testing and maintenance
- **Branch Protection**: Ensures only main branch pushes trigger deployment

**Build Steps Sequence**:
1. **Repository Checkout**: Get latest code from main branch
2. **Node.js Environment**: Set up Node.js version 20 for consistency
3. **Dependency Installation**: Install exact dependencies using `npm ci`
4. **Testing Execution**: Run full test suite to ensure code quality
5. **Production Build**: Generate optimized build artifacts
6. **Deployment Signal**: Successful completion triggers webhook event

**Workflow Event Generation**:
- **workflow_run Event**: Automatically generated by GitHub Actions on workflow completion
- **Event Payload**: Contains workflow status, repository information, and commit details
- **Webhook Delivery**: GitHub automatically delivers workflow_run events to configured webhook endpoints

### Integration with Previous Stories

**Story 005.001 Integration**:
- Webhook secret synchronization enables authentication of GitHub Actions webhook calls
- VPS webhook server can now authenticate workflow_run events from GitHub
- Environment variable configuration supports GitHub Actions webhook delivery

**Story 005.002 Integration**:
- Enhanced webhook payload handler can process workflow_run events from GitHub Actions
- Existing error handling and logging patterns support GitHub Actions integration
- Event type validation supports both ping (testing) and workflow_run (deployment) events

### File Locations and Structure

**GitHub Actions Configuration**:
- **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in repository root
- **Workflow Directory**: `.github/workflows/` for GitHub Actions workflow definitions

**Application Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Application Root**: `jarvis-chat/` directory contains main application
- **Package Configuration**: `jarvis-chat/package.json` with build and test scripts
- **Build Configuration**: `jarvis-chat/vite.config.ts` for production build settings

### Technical Requirements

**Node.js Environment**:
- **Version Consistency**: Node.js version 20 matches development environment
- **Package Management**: Use `npm ci` for exact dependency installation
- **Build Tools**: Utilize existing Vite configuration for production builds

**Testing Integration**:
- **Test Execution**: Run complete test suite before allowing deployment
- **Test Failure Handling**: Terminate workflow on test failures to prevent invalid deployments
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain existing test coverage requirements

**Build Process**:
- **Production Build**: Generate optimized build artifacts using `npm run build`
- **Build Validation**: Ensure build completes successfully before triggering deployment
- **Artifact Management**: Build artifacts prepared for deployment automation

### Webhook Integration Flow

**End-to-End Process**:
1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes code to main branch
2. **Workflow Trigger**: GitHub Actions automatically starts deploy workflow
3. **Build Pipeline**: Checkout, install, test, and build application
4. **Workflow Completion**: Successful build completion generates workflow_run event
5. **Webhook Delivery**: GitHub delivers workflow_run event to VPS webhook server
6. **Authentication**: VPS webhook server validates event using synchronized secret
7. **Event Processing**: Enhanced payload handler processes workflow_run event
8. **Deployment Automation**: VPS deployment automation triggered by successful webhook

**Error Handling Integration**:
- **Build Failures**: Test or build failures prevent workflow_run event generation
- **Webhook Failures**: VPS webhook server error handling from previous stories applies
- **Authentication Failures**: Webhook secret synchronization prevents authentication errors

### Testing Requirements

**Workflow Testing**:
- **Manual Trigger**: Test workflow execution through GitHub Actions interface
- **Branch Push Testing**: Validate workflow triggers on main branch pushes
- **Build Pipeline Testing**: Ensure all build steps execute successfully

**Integration Testing**:
- **End-to-End Flow**: Test complete flow from code push to VPS webhook delivery
- **Webhook Authentication**: Verify webhook calls authenticate successfully with VPS
- **Event Processing**: Confirm VPS webhook server processes workflow_run events correctly

**Error Scenario Testing**:
- **Build Failures**: Test workflow termination on test or build failures
- **Webhook Delivery Failures**: Test GitHub webhook retry mechanisms
- **Authentication Errors**: Test webhook secret mismatch scenarios

## Testing

### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Test Framework**: GitHub Actions workflow testing with manual and automated validation

**Testing Approach**:
- **Workflow Execution Testing**: Manual workflow triggers through GitHub Actions interface
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing from code push to webhook delivery

- **Webhook Delivery**: Verify GitHub delivers workflow_run events to VPS webhook endpoints
- **Authentication**: Test webhook authentication using synchronized secrets from Story 005.001
- **Event Processing**: Validate VPS processes workflow_run events using Story 005.002 enhancements

**Error Scenario Testing**:
- **Test Failures**: Verify workflow terminates on test failures without triggering deployment
- **Build Failures**: Test workflow behavior on build errors and compilation failures
- **Webhook Delivery Issues**: Test GitHub webhook retry mechanisms and error handling
