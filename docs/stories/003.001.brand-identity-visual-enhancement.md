**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **JARVIS user**,  
I want **the application to display consistent "J.A.R.V.I.S OS" branding with an avatar on the login screen and properly positioned version information**,  
So that **I experience a professional, branded interface that reflects the true identity of the system and doesn't interfere with navigation**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: LoginForm.tsx, AuthLayout.tsx, and Sidebar.tsx components
- Technology: React/TypeScript, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS
- Follows pattern: Existing shadcn/ui Card components with proper accessibility
- Touch points: Authentication layout, main navigation sidebar

**User Feedback Requirements:**
1. Login screen currently shows "AI Assistant" text that needs removal
2. Text should change to "J.A.R.V.I.S OS" (with periods)
3. Avatar bubble needed above the text using provided image URL
4. Version modal "JARVIS V1.0 AI Assistant Interface" cuts off left sidebar
5. Modal should be repositioned to footer instead

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Login Screen Branding Update:**
   - Remove "Your AI Assistant" subtitle from AuthLayout component
   - Change main title from "JARVIS" to "J.A.R.V.I.S OS" (with periods)
   - Add avatar image above the title using URL: https://storage.googleapis.com/msgsndr/tfV7ObosaI3yF8QzekD7/media/68784f8d1db129a9bb49461d.png
   - Avatar should be responsive (appropriate sizing for mobile/desktop)
   - Maintain existing accessibility attributes and screen reader support

2. **Modal Repositioning:**
   - Move version information "JARVIS v1.0 AI Assistant Interface" from sidebar bottom section
   - Create new footer component for application-wide use
   - Position version modal in footer with proper styling
   - Ensure footer doesn't interfere with main content or navigation

**Integration Requirements:**

3. Existing authentication flow continues to work unchanged
4. New branding follows existing shadcn/ui design system patterns
5. Integration with Sidebar component maintains current navigation behavior
6. Avatar image loading includes proper error handling and loading states

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Changes are covered by appropriate component tests
8. Accessibility compliance maintained (alt text, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
9. No regression in existing authentication or navigation functionality verified
10. Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
11. Image optimization and proper caching headers for avatar URL

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Update AuthLayout.tsx to modify title text and add avatar component above title
- Remove subtitle prop usage or set to empty string
- Create new Footer.tsx component following existing component patterns
- Update Sidebar.tsx to remove bottom version section
- Integrate Footer component into main AppLayout.tsx

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Follow existing Card component patterns from shadcn/ui
- Use existing accessibility patterns from components/accessibility/
- Maintain existing responsive design patterns using Tailwind classes
- Follow existing component structure with proper TypeScript interfaces

**Key Constraints:**
- Must maintain existing authentication functionality
- Avatar image must handle loading/error states gracefully
- Footer positioning must not interfere with existing layout
- All changes must maintain accessibility compliance
- No breaking changes to existing component APIs

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Avatar Component Creation:**
   ```typescript
   interface AvatarProps {
     src: string;
     alt: string;
     size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
     className?: string;
   }
   ```

2. **Footer Component Structure:**
   ```typescript
   interface FooterProps {
     className?: string;
     showVersion?: boolean;
   }
   ```

3. **AuthLayout Updates:**
   - Add avatar above title with proper spacing
   - Update title text to "J.A.R.V.I.S OS"
   - Remove or modify subtitle handling
   - Maintain responsive design

4. **Sidebar Cleanup:**
   - Remove bottom section containing version info
   - Ensure proper height calculations without bottom section
   - Maintain existing navigation functionality

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Avatar image loading failure could impact login screen aesthetics
- **Mitigation:** Implement proper error handling with fallback to initials or default avatar
- **Rollback:** Revert component changes; original components maintained in version control

**Secondary Risks:**
- Footer positioning could interfere with existing responsive layouts
- Avatar URL could become unavailable affecting branding consistency
- Modal repositioning might affect user familiarity

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs - ✓ (Only internal component changes)
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only - ✓ (No database changes required)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns - ✓ (Uses shadcn/ui components)
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible - ✓ (Single image load, minimal DOM changes)
