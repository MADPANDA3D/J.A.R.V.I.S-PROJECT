# Story 004.002: Conversation History Organization

## Status
âœ… **DONE** - 2025-07-26

## Story

**As a** JARVIS Chat user,
**I want** conversation session grouping and metadata display within the enhanced search interface,
**so that** I can browse and search within specific conversation contexts, organize my chat history effectively, and quickly navigate between different conversation topics or time periods.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Conversation Session Grouping Display**: Implement conversation session grouping within the enhanced MessageSearch interface using existing conversation_sessions table data to organize search results by conversation context

2. **Session Metadata Integration**: Display conversation session metadata (session title, date created, message count, participants) in search interface to provide context for conversation selection

3. **Session-Specific Search Filtering**: Enable users to filter search results within selected conversation sessions, building on the advanced filtering from Story 004.001

4. **Session Navigation and Browsing**: Implement intuitive navigation between conversation sessions within search interface, allowing users to explore conversation history chronologically or by relevance

5. **Search Results Organization**: Organize search results hierarchically by conversation session with clear visual separation and metadata display for improved message discovery

6. **Integration with Enhanced Search**: Ensure conversation history organization integrates seamlessly with advanced search filtering from Story 004.001 while maintaining existing MessageSearch component functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
**Story 004.001 Dependency**: This story builds directly on the advanced message search filtering implemented in Story 004.001. The enhanced MessageSearch component with date range filtering and search result highlighting must be completed before implementing conversation session organization.

### Architecture Context

**Database Schema Integration** [Source: epic-004-message-history-search-enhancement.md]:
- **conversation_sessions table**: Contains session metadata for conversation organization and grouping
- **chat_messages table**: Messages linked to conversation sessions via session_id foreign key
- **Existing relationships**: Messages are already organized by session_id in current database structure

**Component Integration** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Primary Component**: Enhance existing `src/components/chat/MessageSearch.tsx` with session organization
- **Service Layer**: Extend `src/lib/chatService.ts` with session-specific query methods
- **UI Components**: Create new session grouping components in `src/components/chat/` directory

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript for session grouping state management
- Supabase PostgreSQL for conversation_sessions table queries and relationships
- shadcn/ui components for consistent session navigation and grouping UI
- React Query for efficient session data fetching and caching

### Data Model Context

**Conversation Sessions Structure**:
- Session metadata: title, created_date, updated_date, participant_count, message_count
- Session relationships: Foreign key relationship with chat_messages table
- Session organization: Chronological and contextual grouping capabilities

**Search Integration Points**:
- Combined filtering: Text search + date range + session selection
- Result organization: Messages grouped by session with metadata display
- Performance considerations: Pagination within sessions for large conversation histories

### Component Architecture

**Session Grouping Component Structure**:
```typescript
interface ConversationSessionGroup {
  session_id: string;
  title: string;
  created_date: Date;
  message_count: number;
  messages: SearchResult[];
}

interface SessionNavigationProps {
  sessions: ConversationSessionGroup[];
  activeSession?: string;
  onSessionSelect: (sessionId: string) => void;
}
```

**Integration with Story 004.001**: Build upon existing enhanced search state management and filtering logic, extending rather than replacing advanced search functionality.

### File Locations and Structure

**Component Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Enhanced**: `src/components/chat/MessageSearch.tsx` (add session organization)
- **New**: `src/components/chat/ConversationSessionGroup.tsx`
- **New**: `src/components/chat/SessionNavigation.tsx`
- **Extended**: `src/lib/chatService.ts` (add session-specific queries)

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Test files**: `src/components/chat/__tests__/ConversationSessionGroup.test.tsx`
- **Integration tests**: Session organization with advanced search filtering
- **Performance tests**: Large conversation history handling and session grouping efficiency

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Optimization**:
- Session data caching using React Query for improved loading performance
- Lazy loading of session message lists to handle large conversation histories
- Efficient session grouping algorithms for responsive user experience

**State Management Integration**:
- Integrate with existing useChat hook patterns from current chat functionality
- Maintain search state persistence established in Story 004.001
- Ensure session selection state works with advanced filtering state

**Accessibility Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Keyboard navigation between conversation sessions and search results
- Screen reader announcements for session changes and search result organization
- Proper ARIA labels for session groupings and navigation controls

### Integration Pattern Reference

**Session Organization Pattern**: Follow existing chat organization patterns while extending search functionality to include conversation context and metadata display

**Data Fetching Pattern**: Use established Supabase query patterns with React Query for efficient session data management and real-time updates
