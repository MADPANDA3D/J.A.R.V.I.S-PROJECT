# üöÄ AI Chat App Brainstorming Output (with PWA)

**PROJECT:**
Personal AI Chat Platform (React + shadcn + Supabase + n8n + PWA)

**OBJECTIVE:**
Build a next-gen, branded, multimodal chat UI to access your n8n-powered AI agent‚Äîanywhere, anytime, on any device. Core: blazing fast, installable, offline-capable, and future-proof.

---

## **Core Features**

* **Branded, animated chat UI** (text, images, video, audio, files)
* **Live voice call** with agent (TTS/STT, SFX and voice reactions)
* **Persistent chat history** (Supabase, with search and local cache)
* **Tasks/Projects**: context-aware chat spaces, each with file storage (like Claude projects/artifacts)
* **Micro automations**: favorite prompts, cloud-scheduled and trigger-based actions (run even offline)
* **Note-taker mode**: continuous listening with summarized output
* **Augmented calls**: visual aids and live notes
* **End-to-end encryption**: for all chat, files, and calls (milestone for true E2E)
* **Offline banner & reconnect logic**: tells user when they‚Äôre offline, allows search/local access, auto-reconnect + banner when back
* **Installable as a PWA**: full ‚Äúadd to home screen‚Äù experience, cross-platform

---

## **PWA (Progressive Web App) Features**

* **Installable** on mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop with branded icon and splash screen
* **Offline mode**: Browse/search chat history, use core UI when disconnected (messaging and calls disabled, but full transparency)
* **Push notifications**: Real-time alerts for new messages/calls/task updates‚Äîeven when the app is closed (platform-dependent)
* **Silent auto-updates**: No manual installs‚Äîalways up to date
* **Full-screen native UX**: App hides browser chrome, feels like a real app
* **System-wide ‚ÄúAsk Jarvis‚Äù overlay** (future): Tap to open agent from anywhere (PWA shortcut)

---

## **User Experience Flows**

* **Chat**: Send/receive any message type (text, image, video, audio, file), with smooth uploads and previews
* **Call**: Start/receive calls with live audio, SFX, and note-taker
* **Offline**: Banner appears, local chat search enabled; queued messages sync when back online
* **Tasks**: Create/join ‚Äúproject‚Äù spaces, upload docs, chat in context, agent references all artifacts in that task
* **Automations**: Favorite a prompt/action, schedule or trigger via UI, runs via n8n backend (cloud-based)
* **Encryption**: Visual indicators when data is E2E encrypted

---

## **Architecture/Tech Stack**

* **Frontend**:

  * React (w/ shadcn UI, custom branding/animations)
  * PWA support (manifest.json, service worker, offline cache)
  * Supabase JS SDK (auth, real-time, storage, local cache/IndexedDB)
  * Audio/Video APIs (for live calls, note-taker, SFX playback)
* **Backend**:

  * n8n (all business logic, media processing, prompt/call handling, automations)
  * Supabase (chat DB, file store, auth)
  * TTS/STT APIs, SFX catalog
  * Security: TLS, with planned milestone for full end-to-end encryption

---

## **Risks & Mitigations**

* **Mobile media/call bugs**: Early, real-world testing on weak networks/devices
* **Storage costs**: Auto-cleanup, limit file types/sizes, leverage CDN links for large files/media
* **Supabase limits/rate throttling**: Monitor, add smart error messages and fallback modes
* **Auth & security**: Use robust, battle-tested providers; plan E2E as a v2 milestone

---

## **Bonus/Future Features**

* **Multi-agent, multi-user chat (expandable architecture)**
* **Settings**: Theme switcher, voice/personality selector, notification preferences
* **Export/Share**: Download or share chat/tasks as PDF/email/link

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **MVP Scope:** Prioritize: chat, call, offline/PWA, Supabase storage, n8n hooks, basic automations
2. **Wireframes:** Map out chat/call/task/automation UIs
3. **Supabase Schema:** Design tables for users, chats, messages, media, tasks, automations
4. **Tech Stack Planning:** Define React app structure, PWA setup, media handling, state management
5. **Integration Flows:** Document webhook/API contracts with n8n; test every media/call pathway
