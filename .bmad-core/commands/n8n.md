## üî• **SMART COMMANDS**

### `*listworkflows`
**Workflow Discovery & Selection Command**

**Purpose:** Lists all available workflows with their IDs and names for easy selection and execution.

**Usage Examples:**
```
*listworkflows
```

**Returns:** Clean formatted list showing:
- ‚úÖ **Workflow ID** - For direct execution
- ‚úÖ **Workflow Name** - For easy identification
- ‚úÖ **Active Status** - Shows if workflow is currently enabled
- ‚úÖ **Last Execution** - When it was last triggered

**Implementation:**
```
POST {"action": "generate_audit", "data": {}}
Parse response for workflow data and format as numbered list
```

### `*runworkflow [workflow_id] [workflow_id2,workflow_id3]`
**Direct Workflow Execution Command**

**Purpose:** Executes one or multiple workflows by their exact IDs in sequence.

**Usage Examples:**
```
*runworkflow PMB7GfBWQa0DA5rF
*runworkflow nQD2DfOoHx4NqR9z,fgrwSDyD5DLrU6lL,7Kr2aQ20S1RXssBS
```

**Execution Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Single Execution:** Run one workflow instantly
- ‚úÖ **Sequential Execution:** Run multiple workflows in order (comma-separated)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Status:** Shows execution progress for each workflow
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Continues sequence even if one workflow fails
- ‚úÖ **Execution Tracking:** Returns execution IDs for monitoring

**Implementation Flow:**
```
1. Parse workflow IDs (split by comma if multiple)
2. For each workflow ID:
   POST {"action": "trigger_workflow", "data": {"workflowId": "id"}}
3. Monitor execution status and report results
4. Continue to next workflow in sequence
```

## üß† **INTELLIGENT WORKFLOWS**

### **Best Practice: Layer-by-Layer Approach**

#### **Layer 1: Discovery**
```
*audit ‚Üí Understand current system state
*listworkflows ‚Üí See all available workflows with IDs
```

#### **Layer 2: Analysis** 
```
*executions [id] ‚Üí Check performance history
*getworkflow [id] ‚Üí Analyze structure
```

#### **Layer 3: Action**
```
*runworkflow [id] ‚Üí Execute workflow directly
*activate [id] ‚Üí Enable workflow for triggers
*updateworkflow [id] ‚Üí Modify as needed
```

### **Smart Execution Sequence**
```
1. *listworkflows (see available workflows)
2. *runworkflow [id] (execute selected workflow)
3. *executions [id] 10 (monitor execution results)
4. *audit (system health check if needed)
```

### **Maintenance Workflow**
```
1. *audit (security scan)
2. *getworkflow [id] (backup before changes)
3. *deactivate [id] (safe maintenance)
4. *activate [id] (re-enable)
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS STRATEGIES**

### **Workflow Discovery Strategy**
1. **Always start with `*listworkflows`** - See all available workflows with IDs
2. **Use `*runworkflow` for direct execution** - Execute by exact workflow ID
3. **Verify with `*getworkflow`** - Analyze workflow structure when needed

### **Error Recovery Strategy**
1. **Check recent executions first** - `*executions [id] 5`
2. **Analyze workflow structure** - `*getworkflow [id]`
3. **Use audit for system-wide issues** - `*audit`

### **Deployment Strategy**
1. **Test in development** - Create ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Validate
2. **Backup before changes** - `*getworkflow` before `*updateworkflow`
3. **Monitor after deployment** - `*executions` to verify success

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Command Processing Logic**
```javascript
// *runworkflow command processing
1. Parse user input: workflow_id(s) separated by commas
2. For each workflow_id in sequence:
   - POST trigger_workflow action with workflowId
   - Monitor execution status
   - Report results before continuing
3. Handle errors gracefully, continue sequence
4. Return execution summary for all workflows
```

### **Error Handling**
- **Invalid workflow names:** Show available options
- **Multiple matches:** Present selection menu
- **API failures:** Retry with exponential backoff
- **Missing IDs:** Auto-discover via audit

### **Response Formatting**
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "action": "command_executed",
  "timestamp": "ISO_timestamp",
  "data": {...},
  "message": "Human readable result"
}
```
