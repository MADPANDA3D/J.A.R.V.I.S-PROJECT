# README Workflow Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Architect to validate README documentation and VPS deployment guides before project completion. The Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the documentation is comprehensive, accurate, current, and aligned with MADPANDA3D standards.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - REQUIRED ARTIFACTS

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. README.md - The primary project README file (check project root)
2. project-analysis.md - Project assessment document (check docs/project-analysis.md)
3. vps-deployment-guide.md - VPS deployment documentation (check docs/vps-deployment-guide.md if separate)
4. Package files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) for version verification
5. .env.example or environment configuration files
6. Docker files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) if applicable
7. Any existing architecture or technical documentation

IMPORTANT: If any required documents are missing or inaccessible, immediately ask the user for their location or content before proceeding.

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

- Is this a frontend, backend, or full-stack application?
- Does it require VPS deployment documentation?
- Are there Docker containers involved?
- Does it need webhook setup for automated deployment?
- What is the primary technology stack?

README SCOPE DETECTION:
Determine the README update scope:

- New README creation (comprehensive workflow)
- Major update (significant changes, new features)
- Minor update (version bumps, small fixes)
- VPS deployment addition (adding deployment section)

VALIDATION APPROACH:
For each section, you must:

1. Accuracy Verification - Ensure all technical information is correct and current
2. Completeness Check - Verify all necessary information is included
3. Usability Testing - Consider if a new user could successfully follow the instructions
4. Brand Consistency - Ensure MADPANDA3D branding and style guidelines are followed
5. Technical Validation - Test commands and links where possible

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, present findings, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present comprehensive report at end]]
