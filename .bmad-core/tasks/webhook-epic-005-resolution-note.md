# Epic 005 Resolution Status - Webhook Infrastructure Recovery

**Date**: July 26, 2025  
**Status**: COMPLETED - Issues Resolved During Session  
**Context**: Epic 005 was planned but major components were resolved during troubleshooting session

## Issues Successfully Resolved ‚úÖ

### **Story 005.001: GitHub Webhook Configuration Audit and Repair** 
**STATUS: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**What Was Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ **Root Cause Identified**: Webhook secret mismatch between GitHub and VPS systemd service
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Webhook Created**: Properly configured webhook with correct URL and events
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Fixed**: Updated systemd service environment variables with correct secret
- ‚úÖ **Service Restarted**: Webhook server reloaded with new configuration
- ‚úÖ **Verification Complete**: GitHub webhook now returns 200 OK instead of 401

**Technical Details:**
- **GitHub Webhook URL**: `http://69.62.71.229:9000/webhook/deploy` ‚úÖ CONFIGURED
- **Webhook Secret**: Synchronized between GitHub and VPS ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Events**: push, workflow_run ‚úÖ CONFIGURED
- **Authentication**: HMAC SHA-256 signature verification ‚úÖ WORKING

### **Story 005.002: Webhook Server Security and Authentication Enhancement**
**STATUS: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**What Was Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variable Management**: Proper secret separation (WEBHOOK_SECRET vs REPO_SECRET)
- ‚úÖ **Systemd Service Configuration**: Updated `/etc/systemd/system/jarvis-webhook.service`
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Verification**: Webhook signature verification now working
- ‚úÖ **Service Security**: Proper environment variable loading and secret management

### **Story 005.005: VPS Network and Firewall Configuration Audit**
**STATUS: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**What Was Verified:**
- ‚úÖ **Network Connectivity**: External webhook endpoint accessibility confirmed
- ‚úÖ **Port Configuration**: Ports 9000 and 9001 properly configured and accessible
- ‚úÖ **Service Health**: Webhook server healthy and responding to health checks
- ‚úÖ **WebSocket Connectivity**: Real-time notification system operational

## Remaining Epic 005 Stories (For Sarah's Review)

### **Story 005.003: Deployment Pipeline Monitoring and Alerting**
**STATUS: üîÑ STILL NEEDED**
- Real-time deployment monitoring dashboard
- Email/Slack alerting for deployment failures
- Deployment analytics and success rate tracking
- Deployment rollback automation

### **Story 005.004: GitHub Actions Integration Validation** 
**STATUS: üîÑ STILL NEEDED**
- GitHub Actions workflow creation (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Workflow success verification and monitoring
- Manual deployment trigger as backup

## Epic 005 Impact Assessment

**MAJOR RESOLUTION**: 3 out of 5 stories (60%) were resolved during the troubleshooting session.

**Remaining Work**: 
- **Story 005.003** (Monitoring/Alerting) - **Medium Priority**
- **Story 005.004** (GitHub Actions) - **High Priority**

## Recommendations for Sarah

### **Option 1: Remove Completed Stories**
Update Epic 005 to remove:
- ‚úÖ Story 005.001 (Webhook Configuration) - DONE
- ‚úÖ Story 005.002 (Security/Authentication) - DONE  
- ‚úÖ Story 005.005 (Network/Firewall Audit) - DONE

Keep remaining stories:
- üîÑ Story 005.003 (Monitoring/Alerting)
- üîÑ Story 005.004 (GitHub Actions)

### **Option 2: Keep Epic Intact**
During development, Claude will:
- Recognize completed work and skip already-resolved items
- Focus only on remaining unimplemented features
- Update story status as "Previously Completed" with reference to this session

## Auto-Deployment Status

**CURRENT STATE**: 
- ‚úÖ **Webhook Reception**: GitHub ‚Üí VPS communication working
- ‚ùå **GitHub Actions**: No workflow file exists yet (Story 005.004)
- ‚ùå **Deployment Monitoring**: Basic logs only, no advanced monitoring (Story 005.003)

**NEXT CRITICAL STEP**: Create GitHub Actions workflow to trigger webhook deployments on successful builds.

## Technical Configuration Summary

**Working Components:**
- Webhook server: `jarvis-webhook.service` (systemd managed)
- GitHub webhook: Properly configured and authenticated  
- Network connectivity: All ports accessible and firewall configured
- Environment variables: Properly separated and secured

**Ready for Auto-Deployment**: Once GitHub Actions workflow is created, full auto-deployment pipeline will be operational.

**Note for Future Development**: This resolution demonstrates the webhook infrastructure is now production-ready. Any Epic 005 development should focus on monitoring enhancements and GitHub Actions workflow creation only.
